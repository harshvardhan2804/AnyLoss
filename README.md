# AnyLoss: Transforming Classification Metrics into Loss Functions

AnyLoss is a versatile framework that enables the transformation of any confusion matrix-based evaluation metric into a differentiable loss function. This allows for direct optimization of metrics such as F1-score, Precision, Recall, and more during model training—especially useful for imbalanced datasets.

## 📌 Key Features

- **Metric-to-Loss Conversion**: Transform any confusion matrix-based metric into a loss function suitable for optimization.
- **Differentiable Approximation**: Utilizes an approximation function to represent the confusion matrix in a differentiable form.
- **Versatility**: Applicable across various domains, including image classification, text classification, and tabular data analysis.
- **Improved Performance**: Demonstrates enhanced results in imbalanced learning scenarios compared to traditional loss functions.

## 🧠 Background

Traditional evaluation metrics derived from the confusion matrix are non-differentiable, posing challenges for direct optimization during training. AnyLoss addresses this by introducing an approximation function that renders these metrics differentiable, facilitating their use as loss functions in neural network training.
